  Tapovan: ["Tapovan weddings often bring together resort guests, destination groups and families staying close to the river belt.", "We plan the tying window around hotel check-in, photography and the groom's departure so the baraat is not kept waiting."],
  "Muni Ki Reti": ["Muni Ki Reti is a practical base for ceremonies on both sides of the Rishikesh hospitality belt.", "Share the venue and room block early so our artists can arrive together and set up where the full group is getting ready."],
  "Swarg Ashram": ["Swarg Ashram celebrations call for a calm, organised service that respects the character of the neighbourhood.", "We confirm access, guest count and the correct arrival point before assigning the safa team."],
  "Ram Jhula": ["For wedding groups near Ram Jhula, timing and the meeting point matter as much as the chosen pagdi style.", "A short venue-access check helps us avoid delays and keep the groom's styling separate from the larger baraati session."],
  "Laxman Jhula": ["Laxman Jhula is popular with intimate and destination wedding groups looking for a distinctly Rishikesh setting.", "We recommend finalising colours from the outfit palette before the team travels to the getting-ready location."],
  Shivpuri: ["Shivpuri suits resort-led and outdoor wedding schedules where guests may be spread across cottages or camps.", "We build a room-wise tying sequence and bring the selected safas together so the entire party is ready on time."],
  "Bharat Mandir Area": ["Central Rishikesh functions around Bharat Mandir often have family groups arriving from several parts of the city.", "A named family coordinator and a confirmed room for styling keep the service smooth for larger groups."],
  IDPL: ["IDPL-area weddings can accommodate organised family preparation when the guest count is known in advance.", "We divide large orders into groom, close family and baraati batches to protect the ceremony timeline."],
  "Awas Vikas": ["Awas Vikas is well suited to home-based preparations and nearby banquet functions.", "For residential setups, we confirm the working space and start time so every safa is tied before vehicles depart."],
  Shyampur: ["Shyampur celebrations often combine local family ceremonies with guests arriving from outside Rishikesh.", "We keep a clear headcount buffer and coordinate directly with the person managing arrivals."],
  Virbhadra: ["Virbhadra wedding schedules can include home rituals followed by a venue entry elsewhere in Rishikesh.", "Our timing plan accounts for both the groom's detailed styling and the faster baraati tying session."],
  "Ganga Nagar": ["Ganga Nagar families usually need a convenient at-home or hotel safa service rather than a showroom visit.", "We arrive with the agreed colour, ornament plan and team size based on the final guest count."],
  "Barrage Road": ["Barrage Road functions benefit from early coordination when the procession and venue timings are close together.", "We recommend one styling room with good light, mirrors and enough seating for the next group in line."],
  "Nirmal Block": ["Nirmal Block weddings are often intimate enough for personalised groom and family styling.", "We can keep the groom's safa distinct while maintaining a coordinated look for parents, brothers and friends."],
  "Rishikesh Bypass": ["Venues around Rishikesh Bypass are convenient for larger guest movement and destination arrivals.", "Send the map pin rather than only the venue name so the artists reach the correct gate and preparation room."],
  Haridwar: ["Haridwar weddings often balance traditional ceremonies with guests travelling between hotels and venues.", "We confirm the exact Haridwar location, travel window and tying order before accepting the event schedule."],
  Dehradun: ["Dehradun offers a wide mix of hotels, lawns and destination venues, so each safa booking needs a venue-specific plan.", "Our Rishikesh team confirms travel time and may add artists for larger guest counts or early-morning ceremonies."],
  Roorkee: ["Roorkee bookings are planned as an outstation service with a defined arrival and completion window.", "Final quantities and colours should be locked before dispatch because last-minute replacements are less practical away from base."],
  Muzaffarnagar: ["Muzaffarnagar functions usually require a dedicated travelling team for groom and baraati pagdi styling.", "We price the service after reviewing guest count, timing and whether the same team is needed for more than one ceremony."],
  Saharanpur: ["Saharanpur weddings can be covered with advance scheduling from Rishikesh for complete family or baraati groups.", "An early start and one on-site coordinator help the team complete every turban before the procession begins."],
  Najibabad: ["Najibabad is handled as a planned destination assignment rather than an on-call city booking.", "Share the venue pin, reporting time and estimated headcount together for an accurate availability check."],
  Kotdwar: ["Kotdwar celebrations are a natural extension of our Rishikesh service area for organised wedding groups.", "We account for travel and setup time, especially when the groom's ceremony starts early in the day."],
  Lansdowne: ["Lansdowne destination weddings favour elegant, photo-ready safas that suit intimate hill venues.", "Weather, travel and resort access are reviewed before the team departs, and a covered styling area is recommended."],
  Narendranagar: ["Narendranagar's destination venues pair beautifully with refined ivory, rust, maroon and muted gold safa palettes.", "We coordinate with the hotel or planner so the team has access before the groom's photography begins."],
  Devprayag: ["Devprayag functions need careful travel planning and a focused selection of safas brought to the venue.", "We confirm road conditions, event time and accommodation requirements when the schedule starts very early."],
  Doiwala: ["Doiwala is close enough for flexible wedding-day service while still benefiting from a confirmed venue pin.", "Larger groups are assigned multiple artists so the groom, relatives and baraatis finish within the same preparation window."],
  Kaudiyala: ["Kaudiyala resort weddings are usually destination-led, with guests preparing in separate rooms or cottages.", "A central styling lounge and a room-wise guest list make the tying session faster and more comfortable."],
  Tehri: ["Tehri celebrations often use scenic venues where travel time and weather can affect the wedding schedule.", "We build in an arrival buffer and confirm whether the team needs an overnight stay for morning events."],
  Chamba: ["Chamba's hill setting works well with understated groom safas and coordinated family colours.", "The final plan includes venue access, temperature-appropriate fabric choices and enough preparation time for photographs."],
  Mussoorie: ["Mussoorie destination weddings call for polished styling that photographs well in hotel, lawn and hillside settings.", "Traffic, weather and hotel entry rules are checked before confirming the team's reporting time."],
  Vikasnagar: ["Vikasnagar weddings can be served by a scheduled travelling team for the groom and full baraati group.", "We confirm the route, headcount and ceremony sequence before recommending the number of safa artists."],
